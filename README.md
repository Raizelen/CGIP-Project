## Polygon Reflection
This is a Python program that allows the user to input the coordinates of a polygon, and then reflects it across the line y=x using a 3x3 matrix transformation on:
[0,1,0]
[1,0,0]
[0,0,1] 
The program uses the *numpy and turtle* libraries to perform the reflection and display the original and reflected polygons in a graphical window.

## Usage
To use the program, simply run the ```reflected.py``` file in a Python environment. When prompted, enter the number of vertices in the polygon, followed by the x and y coordinates of each vertex.

The program will then display two polygons in a **Turtle** graphics window: the original polygon in blue, and the reflected polygon in red. The x- and y-axes are also displayed in black.

## Dependencies
This program requires the following libraries to be installed:
```
numpy
turtle
```


## Requirements
To run this program, you will need:
```
Python 3.7+
NumPy
PythonTurtle
Code Editor (VS Code etc..)
```
## Usage
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.
- Run the program using the command: python reflect_polygon.py.
- Enter the number of vertices and coordinates of the polygon when prompted.
- The program will display the original polygon in blue and the reflected polygon in red, with the x and y axes labeled and numbered.
