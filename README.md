## Polygon Reflection
This is a Python program that allows the user to input the coordinates of a polygon, and then reflects it across the line y=x using a 3x3 matrix transformation on:
[0,1,0]
[1,0,0]
[0,0,1] 
The program uses the *numpy and turtle* libraries to perform the reflection and display the original and reflected polygons in a graphical window.

## Usage
To use the program, simply run the ```reflected.py``` file in a Python environment. When prompted, enter the number of vertices in the polygon, followed by the x and y coordinates of each vertex.

The program will then display two polygons in a **Turtle** graphics window: the original polygon in blue, and the reflected polygon in red. The x- and y-axes are also displayed in black.

## Dependencies
This program requires the following libraries to be installed:
```
numpy
turtle
flask (web app)
```

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need:
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- PythonTurtle
- Code Editor

## Usage
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.
- Run the program using the command: ```python reflected.py```
- Enter the number of vertices and coordinates of the polygon when prompted.
- The program will display the original polygon in red and the reflected polygon in blue, with the x and y axes labeled.
- Check the 2nd branch - **webapp** to see the web implementation of the project.

## Final Result
**Input**:
```
>python reflected.py
Enter the number of vertices in the polygon: 3
Enter x-coordinate of vertex 1: 2
Enter y-coordinate of vertex 1: 5
Enter x-coordinate of vertex 2: 5
Enter y-coordinate of vertex 2: 7
Enter x-coordinate of vertex 3: 2
Enter y-coordinate of vertex 3: 8 
```
**Output**:
